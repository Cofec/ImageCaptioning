Image Captioning Using Keras
<br>
This project is based on chapter 4 of the thesis written by Karparthy at Stanford. The link is provided below. Given a set of labelled images, we can extract the features of the image using a convolutional network. If we consider the array generated by the convolutional network as an arbitrary unnamed language X, then we can use language modelling techniques to map the features to the captions. 
Dataset: COCO - Common Objects in Context: http://cocodataset.org/. Coco is large dataset containing over 200K+ images with a size of 18G.
